Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. It encourages focusing on a task for a set period (usually 25 minutes) followed by a short break to refresh your mind. After completing four work sessions, take a longer break.

Default Timer Durations
Work Duration: 25 minutes
Short Break: 5 minutes
Long Break: 20 minutes
You can adjust these values in the WORK_MIN, SHORT_BREAK_MIN, and LONG_BREAK_MIN variables in the code if needed.
